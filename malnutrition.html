<h1>Malnutrition- A diseasee that no one cares about</h1>
<p>
    Malnutrition is an imbalance between the nutrients your body needs to function and the nutrients it gets. It can mean undernutrition or overnutrition. You can be malnourished from an overall lack of calories, or you might have a protein, vitamin or mineral deficiency. You might also have more excess calories than your body knows what to do with. Malnutrition continues to be the reason for making children much more vulnerable to diseases and death. There are 4 broad types of malnutrition: wasting, stunting, underweight and overweight. Hence A comprehensive malnutrition analysis provides insights into the extent and consequences of malnutrition, helping inform targeted interventions and policies to improve nutrition and overall health.
